                <h4>HOW CAN I WIN AT TIC-TAC-TOE?</h4>
                <p>To beat the computer (or at least tie), you need to make use of a little bit of strategy. Strategy
                    means figuring out what you need to do to win.</p>

                <p>Part of your strategy is trying to figure out how to get three Xs in a row. The other part is trying
                    to figure out how to stop the computer from getting three Os in a row.</p>

                <p>After you put an X in a square, you start looking ahead. Where's the best place for your next X? You
                    look at the empty squares and decide which ones are good choicesâ€”which ones might let you make three
                    Xs in a row.</p>

                <p>You also have to watch where the computer puts its O. That could change what you do next. If the
                    computer gets two Os in a row, you have to put your next X in the last empty square in that row, or
                    the computer will win. You are forced to play in a particular square or lose the game.</p>

                <p>If you always pay attention and look ahead, you'll never lose a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. You may not
                    win, but at least you'll tie.</p>
